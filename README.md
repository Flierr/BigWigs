Implemented fixes **(Working correctly)**:
- Nefarian landing timer
- Gluth decimate timer
- Anub locust swarm timer
- Twins Teleport fixed repeat Timer 

Implemented fixes **(Testing needed)**:

- Razuvious shout timer

- Firemaw initial wing buffet and repeat buffet timer
- Magmadar fear timer
- Thaddius (throw) timer
- Maexxna spider timer
- The four horsemen mark timer
- Jin'do healing ward timer
- Plague Bars on AQ40 Anubisath Defenders

TODO / current issues:
- The four horsemen (void zones later in the fight seem slightly longer than at the start)
- Baron Geddon Inferno
- Cthun: small eyes are off for like 1-5 secs / no dark glare timer during spell cast / phase 2 initialization working / weaken not working and timers are off after first weaken (how can we know its weakened without combatlog data?)
